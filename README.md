# Task Timer
A tool to measure how much time the user has done a particular task / activity

I made this program with the purpose of both creating a handy tool and to make myself more comfortable with python (and programming in general)
This was created around 7 months ago and since then (September 2019 at time of writing) I have learned more programming techniques.

The goal for this git repository is for me to implement those techniques on this old project and hopefully discover any chance of improvement whilst learning to get used to working with git.

Will be updated with better implementation of programming principles, better design, and decrease/eliminate impractical features
